On your first login, we'll ask for your company name and <abbr title="Employer Identification Number">EIN</abbr>. You can use all employer features as soon as you sign in, but we have to approve you (by confirming your company name and <abbr title="Employer Identification Number">EIN</abbr> are real) before you can view Veteran names or email addresses. This process usually takes less than a day.</p>
